# PostgreSQL Client Authentication Configuration File
# ===================================================

# local      DATABASE  USER  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# host       DATABASE  USER  CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostssl    DATABASE  USER  CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
# hostnossl  DATABASE  USER  CIDR-ADDRESS  METHOD  [OPTIONS]
#
# The first field is the connection type: "local" is a Unix-domain socket,
# "host" is either a plain or SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket, "hostssl" is an
# SSL-encrypted TCP/IP socket, and "hostnossl" is a plain TCP/IP socket.
#
# DATABASE can be "all", "sameuser", "samerole", a database name, or
# a comma-separated list thereof.
#
# USER can be "all", a user name, a group name prefixed with "+", or
# a comma-separated list thereof.  In both the DATABASE and USER fields
# you can also write a file name prefixed with "@" to include names from
# a separate file.
#
# CIDR-ADDRESS specifies the set of hosts the record matches.
# It is made up of an IP address and a CIDR mask that is an integer
# (between 0 and 32 (IPv4) or 128 (IPv6) inclusive) that specifies
# the number of significant bits in the mask.  Alternatively, you can write
# an IP address and netmask in separate columns to specify the set of hosts.
#
# METHOD can be "trust", "reject", "md5", "password", "gss", "sspi", "krb5",
# "ident", "pam", "ldap" or "cert".  Note that "password" sends passwords
# in clear text; "md5" is preferred since it sends encrypted passwords.
#
# OPTIONS are a set of options for the authentication in the format
# NAME=VALUE. The available options depend on the different authentication
# methods - refer to the "Client Authentication" section in the documentation
# for a list of which options are available for which authentication methods.
#
# Database and user names containing spaces, commas, quotes and other special
# characters must be quoted. Quoting one of the keywords "all", "sameuser" or
# "samerole" makes the name lose its special character, and just match a
# database or username with that name.
#

# Notes:
#   'ident' is actually the most secure option for local connections,
local   {{dbname}}  {{dbuser}}                        md5
host    {{dbname}}  {{dbuser}}  127.0.0.1/32          md5

# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD


# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                               ident
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          ident
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all         ::1/128               ident
