# ansible-deployments

This is a repo for, as the name suggests, automated deployments using Ansible.

It is written in such a way as to be scalable and pluggable; starting a new project, mixing-and-matching roles, and getting up-to-speed on the existing codebase should be as easy as possible, and maintaining the result should also be as easy as possible. In order to maintain these constraints, a number of mandatory [guidelines](https://github.com/adeck/ansible-deployments/wiki/guidelines) are enforced for all code present here.

## Why does it look so terrible right now?

At the moment, this repository is relatively new, so a lot of my existing code is being ported here. The format isn't quite the same, and some items must be encrypted before they can be brought here. Additionally, while I have formal specifications in mind, and already somewhat enforced here, much of that still needs to be written in the wiki documentation.

While progress is being made (as monitoring of the issue tracker, wiki, and codebase will attest), this will not be production-ready in any meaningful sense until August 10th.
