# ansible-deployments

This repo is where I keep (some of) my ansible deployments.
Initially, I was keeping them all in separate repositories, because everything in one repo can get extremely cluttered. However, to keep the things I write as DRY and modular as possible, I wanted to make easy role / host pluggability a top priority.
